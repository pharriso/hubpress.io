= Extending the reach of Ansible Tower

At the heart of Ansible is simplicity. One of the great features of Ansible, is the fact that it is agentless. 

But, most customers don't have simple environments to manage. Customers will invariably have multiple datacenters, and within those datacenters they will most likely have isolated networks. 

So how can we extend the reach of Ansible Tower into these isolated networks?

== Simple example environment

I'm going to use a really simple example here to explain what this might look like. In reality, customers tend to have multiple datacenters and lot's of isolation between networks.

== Two ways to extend the reach

Isolated nodes 

SSH Proxy
