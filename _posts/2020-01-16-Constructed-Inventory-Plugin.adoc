= Constructed Inventory Plugin

Ansible is agentless, needs an inventory.

We need a way of targeting the right hosts with Ansible - normally groups.

Dynamic inventories are a great tool. They provide out of the box groups. But, they also provide rich information and facts.

We can use those facts to construct additional groups to meet our automation needs.

Example with foreman to show groups. 

Example facts we get.

Example - I want a group for all servers of type a,b or c.

This allows me to assign variables to these groups as well.
